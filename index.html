The magnificent door to the residence of knowledge flushed open and young mortals hurtled into the vast open space, for it was the first day of school. It was a stampede amongst the big children, whilst the small ones would seek protection by walking on the side. A common phrase that could be heard when I was engulfed in the crowd was, “Hurrah! Back to School we come!”. 

The chaos was finally interrupted by the principal who commanded us to walk and form lines in an orderly fashion. I sallied with my companions and steered my eyes down as the principal glared at us. I was flabbergasted to see such a huge assembly field, where from lightyears away, creatures, if any, would consider it as a mere particle motionless and congenial to a distant and antique rocket. 

The principal chirped in her sweet voice, which made me wonder, for she had a disparate appearance. Pouring all my concentration onto what the principal was saying, I was still able to hear faint buzzes that seemingly got louder after every syllable of the principal’s speech, until it exploded into a communicable and irresistible laughter. Finally, the principal clapped, and whistles rung and echoed. A hand of teachers began to shout and the principal’s contradictory chirp at last cured the laughter. 

Observing my surroundings for a split - second, everything slowed down. I saw a falling pot, beseeching to be pushed or getting caught in benevolent hands, else it might harm a student below. Also, seeing the principal slowly yet amusingly transitioning to her rufescent expression as a reaction to someone dropping coffee on her dress, made me roll in laughter. The sight of the newly painted buildings made the school shine amongst its dull neighbors. 

On the first day itself, there were rumors that a huge football turf had been formed within the school, and it perhaps was obscured by the towering school building. All were eager to see the turf, but it would take the stealthiest of the students to get past the heavily guarded boundaries of the assembly area. 

Moving into the heart of the assembly area, I witnessed the pleasant environment of the school, so pleasant, that the dwellers of the Garden of Eden would envy it. There were bright blooming trees, a variety of birds, impenetrable patches of green grass and fresh air that made the lush trees sway. A thought of this scenery was hindered with constant chatter and surprisingly, moaning. Tracing the moaning, I found innumerable students producing it. They were despairing for growing older and about their past mistakes. Trying to cure it, I myself got infected. 

Unpredictably, the principal emerged from the crowd and spoke out, “We must forget the negative past, but remember the positive one. We must learn from our mistakes and not fear them. We should have love for the past but must live in the present as the present is our current circumstance. The present can significantly alter our future and for a good future, we thus need a good present”. 

This speech somehow wilted all of us and the sound of the applause developed to savage lion’s roar. The principal smiled, which finally revealed her true face, a jolly face. Students cheered and departed with a new meaning of school, being “the opportunity to change”. I stayed back, and saw the fiery sun collapse. Bon Voyage it said, indeed, Bon Voyage!
